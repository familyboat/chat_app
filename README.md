# Chat app

This is my toy app, modified version of [deno's showcase_chat][showcase_chat] with [latest fresh][fresh], [supabase][supabase], [WebSocket][websocket] and [tailwind][tailwind].

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno:
https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation

Then start the project in development mode:

```
deno task dev
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
